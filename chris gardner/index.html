          <h3>Here's about chris gardner's  life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>YOUNG LIFE</strong> - Gardner was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on February 9, 1954, to Thomas Turner and Bettye Jean Gardner. He was both the second child and the only boy born to Bettye Jean. His older half-sister, Ophelia, is from a previous union. His younger sisters, Sharon and Kimberly, are children from his mother's marriage to Freddie Triplett.Gardner did not have many positive male role models as a child, as his stepfather was physically abusive to both his mother and his sisters. When Gardner was eight years old, he and his sisters returned to foster care for the second time</li>
            

 <li><strong>EARLY ADULTHOOD</strong> - Inspired by his Uncle Henry's worldwide adventures in the U.S. Navy, Gardner decided to enlist when he finished secondary schooling. He was stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina for four years, where he was assigned as a medical corpsman. He became acquainted with a decorated San Francisco cardiac surgeon, Dr. Robert Ellis, who offered Gardner a position assisting him with innovative clinical research at the University of California Medical Center and Veterans Administration Hospital in San Francisco. Gardner accepted the position, and moved to San Francisco upon his discharge from the Navy in 1974</li>
            <li><strong>MARRIAGE</strong> - On June 18, 1977, Chris Gardner married Sherry Dyson, a Virginia native and an educational expert in mathematics.  With his knowledge, experience and contacts within the medical field, it appeared Gardner had his medical career plans laid out before him.His relationship with Sherry was detached, in part because of his decision to abandon a medical career and also due to differences in their behavior. Then he came together with Jackie Medina and had a child.Their son, Christopher Jarrett Gardner, Jr. was born on January 28, 1981.</li>
            <li><strong>JOB</strong> - Gardner worked as a research lab assistant at UCSF and at the Veterans' Hospital after leaving the service. His position as a research lab assistant paid only about $8,000 a year, which was not enough for him to support a live-in girlfriend and a child. After four years, he quit these jobs and doubled his salary by taking a job as a medical equipment salesman.He decided becoming a stockbroker to live a better and lxurious life.Gardner gained a position in Dean Witter Reynolds' stock brokerage training program. However, this offered no salary; apart from selling medical equipment that brought in 300–400 dollars a month in the early 1980s, and with no savings, he was unable to meet his living expenses.Gardner worked to become a top trainee at Dean Witter Reynolds. He arrived at the office early and stayed late each day, persistently making calls to prospective clients with his goal being 200 calls per day. His perseverance paid off when, in 1982, Gardner passed his Series 7 Exam on the first try and became a full employee of the firm. Eventually, Gardner was recruited by Bear Stearns & Company in San Francisco</li>        
            <li><strong>FATHERHOOD AND HOMELESSNESS</strong> - About four months after Jackie disappeared with their son, she returned and left him with Gardner. By then, he was earning a small salary and was able to afford rooming in a flophouse. He willingly accepted sole custody of his child; however, the rooming house where he lived did not allow children. Although he was gainfully employed, Gardner and his son secretly struggled with homelessness while he saved money for a rental house in Berkeley.Meanwhile, none of Gardner's co-workers knew that he and his son were homeless.Gardner often scrambled to place his child in daycare, stood in soup kitchens and slept wherever he and his son could find safety—in his office after hours, at flophouses, motels, parks, airports, on public transport, and even in a locked bathroom at a BART station</li>        
            <li><strong>CAREER AS STOCKBROKER</strong> -In 1987, Gardner established the brokerage firm, Gardner Rich & Co, in Chicago, Illinois, an "institutional brokerage firm specializing in the execution of debt, equity, and derivative products transactions for some of the nation's largest institutions, public pension plans, and unions."Gardner reportedly owns 75 percent of his stock brokerage firm with the rest owned by a hedge fund. </li>
